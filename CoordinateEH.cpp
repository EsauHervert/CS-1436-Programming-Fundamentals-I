/*
Write a C++ program that prompts the user to input the x-y coordinates of a point on a Cartesian
plane. The program should then output a message indicating whether the point is the origin, is located on the x or y axis, or appears in a particular quadrant. For example:

(0, 0) is the origin
(4, 0) is on the x-axis
(0, -3) is on the y-axis
(-2, 3) is in quadrant two

Output should look similar to below.
Sample Run:
Enter the x coordinate: 4
Enter the y coordinate: 5

The point (4, 5) is in quadrant I

/*
Notes:
	Do not check for invalid inputs.  Name your program:  CoordinateXX.cpp, where XX are your initials.
	Set numbers as doubles.
