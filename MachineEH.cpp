/*
The program should create an array of three structures.  The elements should be initialized with the following data:

Drink Name
Drink Cost
Number of Drink in Machine

The machine has $10 worth of change if needed.

Each time the program runs, it should enter a loop that performs the following steps:
-	It should display a menu of drinks the vending machine contains. [X]
-	The program should wait until the user enters a drink or press the quit command.  [X]
	The quit command (choose the command you want) should not be visible to the end user. [X]
	Also after one transaction it should display the menu again and wait for the next transaction. [X]
-	If the user selects a drink.  The user should be prompted to input the amount of the drink. [X]
-	Data validation.  If the user entered a max amount the machine cannot handle inform the user. [X]
	For example if the machine cannot accept $20 or greater then give an error message to the user. [X]  
	If the user puts in amount less than amount prompt them what value they need to input.  [X]
	If the user gets change back display the change amount.  [X]
	In addition to decrement inventory.	[]
-	If the user selects a drink that has sold out, a message should be displayed.  The loop then repeats. [X]
-	When the user chooses to quit the program it should display the total amount of money the machine earned in a report.  [X]
	Name the report SalesReport.txt.	[X]

The manner in which you display the output is of your choosing along with the appropriate error messages. With that being said make sure that the output is clean and clear 
to the user. You do not want the user to guess what he or she has to do.   Make sure all parts of your program check for correct data entry. Name the file
