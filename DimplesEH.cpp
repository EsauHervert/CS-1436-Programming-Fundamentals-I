/* This lab is meant to calculate the amount of dimples on new golf balls. We are to get the surface area and the area for one golf ball dimple.
we are also given that the surface area of a sphere is SA == 4 * PI * r^2. We are to prompt the user to give us the diameter of the golf ball in inches.
we are to display to them: the ball's diameter, surface area, and total amount of dimples.*/

/* Notes:
	The imput is in diameters but the equation deals with radius so a conversion must take place.
	The dimple count must be an interger and the other values must be at a 2 decimal precision.
