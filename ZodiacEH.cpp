/*Write a C++ program where the user types in a birthday (month and day) the program responds with the appropriate
western zodiac sign for that birthday.The month is entered as a number from 1 to 12 and day as 1 to 31.
Use a function to determine the western zodiac sign associated with the date entered. Check for date validation
to all parts to your program. The program should also include a loop that lets the user repeat this calculation until the
user says he/she is done. Output should look similar to below.*/
