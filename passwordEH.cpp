/*
Implement the all the following as C++ programs for full credit.  Submit only .cpp files only.
Imagine you are developing a software package that required users to enter their own passwords.   You software requires that users’ passwords meet the follow criteria.
	The password should be at least 10 characters long.
	The password should contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter.
	The password should have at least one digit.
Write a program that asks for a password and then verifies that it meets the states criteria.  If it doesn’t, the program should display a message telling the user why it 
failed.  For example, “mypasswords” fails to meet at least one upper case and does not contain a digit.  If it fails to meet more than one criteria it should display all 
the reasons why it failed.  Name the file passwordXX.cpp

What needs to be done?
	Have a program that detects if there are 10 characters in a password. Check if there is at least one uppercase, one lower case, and one number.

How will it be done?
	Create a array that can be as long as the person having to imput the password wants it to be.
	Have it be at least 10 characters long, have an uppercase and a lowercase letter and have a digit.
