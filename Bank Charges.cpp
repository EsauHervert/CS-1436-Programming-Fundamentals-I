	/*A bank charges $10 per month plus the following check fees for a commercial checking
	account:
	$.10 each for fewer than 20 checks
	$.08 each for 20–39 checks
	$.06 each for 40–59 checks
	$.04 each for 60 or more checks
	The bank also charges an extra $15 if the balance of the account falls below $400 (before
	any check fees are applied). Write a program that asks for the beginning balance and the
	number of checks written. Compute and display the bank’s service fees for the month.
	Input Validation: Do not accept a negative value for the number of checks written. If a
	negative value is given for the beginning balance, display an urgent message indicating
	the account is overdrawn.*/
